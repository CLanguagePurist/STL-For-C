# Standard Template Library for C Language

A free library of generic data types for C programming language.

### List of Available Types
1. List/Vector (Non-concurrent)
2. Concurrent Queue
3. Dictionary/Hashtable (Non-concurrent)
4. Event Handler (Non-concurrent)

### Work in Progress Types
1. Concurrent List/Vector
2. Concurrent Stack
3. Concurrent Dictionary/Hashtable
4. Hashset
5. Single Linked List
6. Doubly Linked List
7. Queue
8. Stack
9. Got an idea? Submit a request in project issues!

## Why STL for C?
1. Usable Datatypes for C Programmers
2. Templated data types in a sense that this library leverages preprocessor to allow for data type substitution for each container type avoiding a pointer indirection performance cost that most data container in C are written for.
3. Foreign Function Interface considerations

## How to use this library?

WIP.
